Hi, I'm Atharva Sabnis, a globally recognized metaverse/web3 strategist, tech futurist, sought-after business executive, speaker and media personality with deep expertise working in NFT and metaverse-related fields with prominent web2 companies. 
I've been featured in Forbes India, Mint, Business Today, Money Control, and have appeared in interviews with web3 influencers like Kevin Abdulrahman, Kashif Raza, and Arcane Bear.
